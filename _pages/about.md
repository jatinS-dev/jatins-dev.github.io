I am a passionate Computer Science graduate student at the University of Florida, specializing in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Distributed Systems. My research focuses on multimodal AI applications, particularly in healthcare and accessibility domains.

## Research & Experience

My journey spans from building **real-time ML systems** at ICICI Bank impacting 10M+ customers, to developing **state-of-the-art multimodal summarization** architectures that outperform GPT-3.5 & GPT-4V. I've had the privilege of working as a **MITACS Globalink Research Intern** at Polytechnique de Montr√©al, where I built decision support systems processing 20,000+ datasets across 30 cities.

## Technical Expertise

I specialize in **Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow** for ML/AI, **React.js, Node.js** for full-stack development, and **Docker, AWS, Linux** for scalable deployments. My work spans from **real-time ASL recognition** achieving 94% accuracy, to **clinical NLP** and **multimodal summarization** systems.

## Open Source & Community

As a **Google Summer of Code** participant and **JoomlaCMS** contributor, I'm passionate about open source development and mentoring. I've developed modular frameworks that have reduced user onboarding drop-off by 20% and have been adopted globally.

## Current Focus

Currently pursuing my Master's at UF, I'm exploring the intersection of **multimodal learning**, **clinical AI**, and **distributed systems**. I'm always excited about new research collaborations and opportunities to apply AI for social good.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), [projects](/projects/), and [CV](/cv/) to learn more about my work. I'm always open to discussing research opportunities, collaborations, or just having a chat about technology!
