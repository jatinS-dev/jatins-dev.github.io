  title={From Sights to Insights: Towards Summarization of Multimodal Clinical Documents},
  author={Salve, Jatin Avinash and others},
  abstract={We present EDI-Summ, a novel multimodal summarization architecture that combines contextual and cross-attention mechanisms for clinical document summarization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.81 factual recall and 3.51 clinical score, outperforming GPT-3.5 and GPT-4V on clinical summarization tasks. The system integrates visual and textual information from clinical documents to generate comprehensive summaries that maintain both factual accuracy and clinical relevance.},
